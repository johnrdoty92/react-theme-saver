# React Theme Saver

This is a simple web app that allows designers to play with color themes and see them update immediately on the screen. Choose whether you want to use a 2 tone complementary theme or a monochromatic theme and start picking colors.

If you find a theme you like, you can name and save it to local storage. You can also copy the colors used.

This project uses **React**, **styled-components**, and **localStorage**.
